WELL WELL WELL you all really went out and left my greatest expectations in shambles this week.{Smiling face with open mouth and tightly-closed eyes} Word on the street is you made Fearless (my version) the biggest country album 1st week of the last 6 years & the top release of 2021 so far. Honestly?? How?? Did I get this lucky??
